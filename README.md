## No Engine 2.0 Breakdown
> **A break down of the project**  

## Setup

  The `stages` folder is stages of the engine broken down into multiple files, each containing an html and js file. They also have my study notes (comments) explaining parts of the code.
  You can replace the `index.html` and `main.js` code, with anyone of them. Just make sure the file names match in the code.

  run with `npx serve`.

  God speed ðŸ”¥
